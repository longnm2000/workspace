    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <p class="p1">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage</p>
    <p class="p2">With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between the elements,
        how elements are postioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be
         used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
    </p>
    <p class="p3">
        <b>Tip:</b> The word <b>cascading</b> means that a style applied to a parent element will also
        apply to all childrens elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text 
        to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and others text elements within the body will also get
         the same color (unless you specily something else)!
